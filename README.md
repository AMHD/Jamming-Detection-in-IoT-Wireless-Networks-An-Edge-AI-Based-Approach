# Dataset 
### Each dataset corresponds to the following Jamming type (click on the name for direct access to the RAW files):
- [Normal Channel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AMHD/Jamming-Detection-in-IoT-Wireless-Networks-An-Edge-AI-Based-Approach/main/normal_channel.txt)
- [Constant Jammer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AMHD/Jamming-Detection-in-IoT-Wireless-Networks-An-Edge-AI-Based-Approach/main/constant_jammer.txt)
- [Random Jammer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AMHD/Jamming-Detection-in-IoT-Wireless-Networks-An-Edge-AI-Based-Approach/main/random_jammer.txt)

Please refer to the [Published] for more information on how the data is collected.

### Each dataset file contains one column:

- **Received Signal Strength (RSS)**
